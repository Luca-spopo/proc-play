    <h3><a name="about" href="#toc-about">About this document</a></h3>
    So far, I have found two really great sources for information about Perlin noise.
    They are Ken Perlin's <a href="http://www.noisemachine.com/talk1/">Making Noise</a>
    web site, which has a comprehensive introduction to the topic, and
    <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm">Hugo Elias's page</a>,
    which features some algorithms and a few more detailed examples
    of applications.  This document is intended to complement those
    two valuable resources by explaining in more depth, hopefully in plain English,
    some of the math involved in Ken Perlin's 
    <a href="http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/%7Eperlin/doc/oscar.html#noise">original implementation</a>
    of Perlin noise.<p>
    
    I wrote a demo program in C++ that includes a Perlin noise texture class,
    which I hope provides a decent example of C++ code for Perlin noise.  You
    can find the demo at
    <a href="http://www.robo-murito.net/code.html">http://www.robo-murito.net/code.html</a>.</p><p>

    <h3><a name="whatsnoise" href="#toc-whatsnoise">What is Perlin noise?</a></h3>

    Perlin noise is function for generating coherent noise over a space.
    <i>Coherent</i> noise means that for any two points in the space, the value 
    of the noise function changes smoothly as you move from one point to
    the other -- that is, there are no discontinuities.<p>

    <i>Non-coherent noise (left) and Perlin noise (right)</i></center><p>

    When I talk about a noise function, I mean a function that takes a coordinate 
    in some space and maps it to a real number between -1 and 1.  Note that
    you can make noise functions for any arbitrary dimension.  The noise functions
    above are 2-dimensional, but you can graph a 1-dimensional noise function
    just like you would graph any old function of one variable, or consider
    noise functions returning a real number for every point in a 3D space.</p><p>
    
    These images were all created using nothing but Perlin noise:</p><p>

    Besides these trivial images, there are countless interesting applications 
    for noise in computer graphics. Look at
    <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm">Hugo Elias' page</a>
    or <a href="http://www.noisemachine.com/talk1/">Ken Perlin's pages</a>
    for some pretty examples, in-depth explanations and nifty ideas.<p>

    <h3><a name="algorithm" href="#toc-algorithm">How do you generate Perlin noise?</a></h3>
    I've seen implementations on the internet that take non-coherent noise,
    as shown above, and smooth it (with something like a blur function) 
    so it becomes coherent noise, but that can end up being more
    computationally expensive than the function I'll present here, which
    is more or less the 
    <a href="http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/%7Eperlin/doc/oscar.html#noise">original implementation</a>
    that Ken Perlin came up with.
    The problem with Perlin's implementation on its own was that
    that reading the descriptions of the math published on 
    Perlin's website was a bit like reading Greek -- it took me about a
    week of reading his code and notes to figure out the actual geometric
    interpretations of the math.  So hopefully this document
    can trim down that learning curve.<p>
    
    Let's look at the 2D case, where
    we have the function
    </p><blockquote><i>noise2d</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) = <i>z</i>,</blockquote>
    with <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> all real (floating-point) numbers.     
    We'll define the noise function on a regular grid, where grid points
    are defined for each whole number, and any number with a fractional
    part (<i>i.e.</i> 3.14) lies between grid points.  Consider finding
    the value of <i>noise2d</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>), with
    <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> both not whole numbers -- that is, the point
    (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) lies somewhere in the middle of a square in our
    grid. The first thing we
    do is look at the gridpoints surrounding (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>).
    In the 2D plane, we have 4 of them, which we
    will call (<i>x</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>0</sub>), 
    (<i>x</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>),
    (<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>0</sub>), and
    (<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>).<p>

    </p><center><img src="The%20Perlin%20noise%20math%20FAQ_files/cornergridpoints.gif" height="138" width="148"><br>
    <i>The 4 grid points bounding (x, y)</i></center><p>
    
    Now we need a function 
    </p><blockquote><i>g</i>(<i>x</i><sub>grid</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>grid</sub>) 
    = (<i>g</i><sub>x</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>y</sub>)</blockquote>
    which takes each grid point and assigns
    it a pseudorandom gradient of length 1 in <b>R</b><sup>2</sup>
    ('gradient' is just the name for an ordered pair or vector that we think of 
    as pointing in a particular direction).
    By <i>pseudorandom</i>,
    we mean that <i>g</i> has the appearance of randomness, but with the
    important consideration that it always returns the same gradient for the 
    same grid point, every time it's calculated.  It's also important that 
    every direction has an equal chance of being picked.<p>
    
    </p><center><img src="The%20Perlin%20noise%20math%20FAQ_files/gradients.gif" height="258" width="246"><br>
    <i>The 4 pseudorandom gradients associated with the grid points</i></center><p>
    
    Also, for each grid point, we generate a vector going from the grid point
    to (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>), which is easily calculated by subtracting the
    grid point from (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>).</p><p>
    
    </p><center><img src="The%20Perlin%20noise%20math%20FAQ_files/cornervectors.gif" height="100" width="191"><br>
    <i>Vectors from the grid points to (x, y)</i></center><p>
    
    Now we have enough to start calculating the value of the noise function
    at (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>).  What we'll do is calculate the influence
    of each pseudorandom gradient on the final output, and generate
    our output as a weighted average of those influences.</p><p>
    
    First of all, the influence of each gradient can be calculated by performing
    a dot product of the gradient and the vector going from its associated grid
    point to (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>).  
    A refresher on the dot product -- remember, it's just the sum of the products
    of all the components of two vectors, as in
    
    </p><blockquote>
    (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) · (<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>) = 
    <i>ac</i> + <i>bd</i> .
    </blockquote>

    Since I'm really tired of writing subscripts, we'll just refer to these
    4 values as <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, and <i>v</i>, where    

    <blockquote>
    <i>s</i> = <i>g</i>(<i>x</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>0</sub>) ·
               ((<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) - (<i>x</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>0</sub>)) , <br>
    
    <i>t</i> = <i>g</i>(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>0</sub>) ·
               ((<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) - (<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>0</sub>)) , <br>

    <i>u</i> = <i>g</i>(<i>x</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>) ·
               ((<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) - (<i>x</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>)) , <br>

    <i>v</i> = <i>g</i>(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>) ·
               ((<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) - (<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>)) .
    </blockquote>

    So here's a 3D-ish picture of some influences <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, 
    and <i>v</i> coming out of the <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> plane (note that 
    these probably wouldn't be the actual values generated by the dot products of 
    the vectors pictured above).<p>
    
    </p><center><img src="The%20Perlin%20noise%20math%20FAQ_files/zcomponents.gif" height="83" width="141"><br>
    <i>Influences from the grid points</i></center><p>
    
    Geometrically, the dot product is proportional to the cosine of the angle
    between two vectors, though its unclear to me if that geometrical interpretation
    helps one visualize what's going on.  The important thing to know at this 
    point is that we have four numbers, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, and <i>v</i>
    which are uniquely determined by (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) and the 
    pseudorandom gradient function <i>g</i>.
    Now we need a way to combine them to get <i>noise2d</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>),
    and as I suggested before, some sort of average will do the trick.</p><p>
    
    I'm going to state the obvious here and say that if we want to take an average of 
    four numbers, what we can actually do is this:
    </p><ol>
      <li>find the average of the first pair of numbers
      </li><li>find the average of the second pair of numbers
      </li><li>average those two new numbers together
    </li></ol>
    -- and that's the strategy we'll take here.
    We'll average the "front" values <i>s</i> and <i>t</i> first, then average
    the "rear" values <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>.  This works to our advantage because
    the points below <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>, and similarly below <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>
    vary only in the x dimension -- so we only have to worry about dealing with
    one dimension at a time.<p>

    We're not taking a plain vanilla-flavored average here, but instead, a 
    weighted average.  That is, the value of the noise function should be influenced
    more by <i>s</i> than <i>t</i> when <i>x</i> is closer to <i>x</i><sub>0</sub>
    than <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> (as is the case in the pictures above).  In fact, it ends
    up being nice to arrange things so that <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values behave as if
    they are slightly closer to one grid point or the other than they actually are
    because that has a smoothing effect on the final output.  I know that sounds
    really silly, but noise without this property looks really stupid.  In fact,
    it sounds so silly that I'm going to write it again: <i>we're going to want
    the input point to behave as if its closer to one grid point or another than 
    it actually is</i>.</p><p>

    This is where we introduce the concept of the ease curve.  The function
    3<i>p</i>²&nbsp;-&nbsp;2<i>p</i>³ generates a nice S-shaped curve
    that has a few characteristics that are good for our purposes.</p><p>
    
    </p><center><img src="The%20Perlin%20noise%20math%20FAQ_files/scurve.gif" height="112" width="108"><br>
    <i>Meet the ease curve</i></center><p>
    
    What the ease curve does is to exaggerate the proximity its input
    to zero or one. For inputs that are sort of close to zero, it outputs a number
    <i>really</i> close to zero.  For inputs close to one, it outputs
    a number <i>really</i> close to one. And when the input is exactly one half,
    it outputs exactly one half.  Also, it's symmetrical in the sense that it 
    exaggerates to the same degree on both sides of <i>p</i> = ½.    
    So if we can treat one grid point as the zero value, and the other as the 
    one value, the ease curve has the exact smoothing effect that just we 
    said we wanted.</p><p>
    
    Ok, I've droned on long enough, it's calculation time:
    first, we take the value of the ease curve
    at <i>x</i> - <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> to get a weight <i>S</i><sub>x</sub>.    
    Then we can find the weighted average of <i>s</i> and <i>t</i> by constructing
    a linear function that maps 0 to <i>s</i> and 1 to <i>t</i>, and evaluating
    it at our x dimension weight <i>S</i><sub>x</sub>. We'll call this average <i>a</i>.    
    We'll do the same for <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>, and call the result <i>b</i>.</p><p>

    <i>Finding the first two averages using linear interpolation</i></center><p>

    The above figures should satisfy you that no matter where <i>x</i> happens
    to fall in the grid, the final averages will always be between <i>s</i> and
    <i>t</i>, and <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>, respectively.
    Mathematically, this is all simple to calculate:
    </p><blockquote>
    <i>S</i><sub>x</sub> = 3(<i>x</i> - <i>x</i><sub>0</sub>)² - 
    2(<i>x</i> - <i>x</i><sub>0</sub>)³ <br>
    <i>a</i> = <i>s</i> + <i>S</i><sub>x</sub>(<i>t</i> - <i>s</i>)<br>
    <i>b</i> = <i>u</i> + <i>S</i><sub>x</sub>(<i>v</i> - <i>u</i>)
    </blockquote>
    
    Now we find our y dimension weight, <i>S</i><sub>y</sub>,  by
    evaluating the ease curve at <i>y</i> - <i>y</i><sub>0</sub>,
    and finally we take a weighted sum of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> to get 
    our final output value <i>z</i>.<p>
    
    </p><center>

    <i>A weighted sum of the first two averages yields the final output</i></center><p>
    
    And there you have it.  So all you have to do is call the noise function
    for every pixel you want to color, and you're done.  Probably.
    
    </p><center>
    <h3>...and they all lived happpily ever after.</h3>
    <h1>The End.</h1></center><p>
    
    An interesting consequence of all of this is that the noise function becomes
    zero when <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are both whole numbers.
    This is because the vector (<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>) - 
    (<i>x</i><sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;<i>y</i><sub>0</sub>) will be the zero vector.  
    Then the dot product of that vector and 
    <i>g</i>(<i>x</i><sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;<i>y</i><sub>0</sub>)will evaluate
    to zero, and the weights for the averages will also always be zero, so 
    that the zero dot product will influence the final answer 100%.  The funny
    thing is that looking at the noise function, you would never guess that it ends up
    being zero at regular intervals.</p><p>
    
    </p><hr noshade="noshade">
    
    <h3><a name="computation" href="#toc-computation">Computational complexity</a></h3>
    If you want to extend the noise function to <i>n</i> dimensions, you'll need
    to consider 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> grid points, and perform 
    2<sup>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)</sup> weighted sums.  The implementation presented
    here has a computational complexity of O(2<sup>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)</sup>),
    which means that you'll really start to drag if you want to look at 5-, 6-, or
    greater dimensional noises.<p>
    
    </p><hr noshade="noshade">
    
    <h3><a name="speed" href="#toc-speed">Speeding it up</a></h3>
    We could increase the speed of the noise function if we didn't have to compute
    the pseudorandom gradient every time we called the noise function (because for every
    <i>x</i> between some <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> and
    <i>y</i> between some <i>y</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>, we have
    to recalculate the same four gradients every time the noise function is called!)
    The nice thing to do would be to precalculate the gradient for every possible
    (<i>x</i><sub>grid</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>grid</sub>), but 
    <i>x</i><sub>grid</sub> and <i>y</i><sub>grid</sub> are allowed to 
    vary all over the real plane! How could we possible precalculate <i>every</i> value?<p>
 
    The neat thing about noise is that it's locally variable, but globally flat --
    so if we zoom out to a large degree, it will just look like a uniform value
    (zero in fact).  So, we don't care if the noise function starts to repeat after
    large intervals, because once you're zoomed out far enough to see the repeat,
    it all looks totally flat anyways.</p><p>
    
    So now we should feel justified in doing a little trick with modulus.
    Say we're doing noise in 3D, and we
    want to find the gradient for some grid point
    (<i>i</i>,&nbsp;<i>j</i>,&nbsp;<i>k</i>).    
    Let's precompute a permutation table <i>P</i>, that maps every integer
    from 0 to 255 to another integer in the same range (possibly even the same number).    
    Also, let's precompute a table of 256 pseudorandom gradients and put it in
    <i>G</i>, so that <i>G</i>[<i>n</i>] is some 3-element gradient.</p><p>
    
    Now,  </p><blockquote>
    <i>g</i>(<i>i</i>,&nbsp;<i>j</i>,&nbsp;<i>k</i>) = <i>G</i>[
    ( <i>i</i> + <i>P</i>[ (<i>j</i> + <i>P</i>[<i>k</i>]) mod 256 ] ) mod 256 ]
    </blockquote>
    
    But on a computer, modulus with 256 is the same thing as a bitwise and
    with 255, which is a very fast operation to perform.  Now we've reduced
    the problem of a possibly involved function call into nothing but some
    table lookups and bitwise operations.  Granted, the gradients repeat every 256
    units in each dimenstion, but as demonstrated, it doesn't matter.<p>
    
    This speedup is also mentioned on Perlin's web page, and is actually used in his
    <a href="http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/%7Eperlin/doc/oscar.html#noise">original implementation</a>.
    </p><p>
   
    </p><hr noshade="noshade">
    
    <h3><a name="loop" href="#toc-loop">Looping noise</a></h3>

    What if you want to use procedural noise to calculate a repeating animation of
    a licking flame or rolling clouds?  It is true that noise on it's own doesn't
    tend to repeat discernably, and that's great for generating ever-changing images; 
    however, if you want to prerender an animation, you'll probably want it to repeat.
    Given that <i>F</i> is your function that generates a real number from
    a point in noise-space, and you want your animation to repeat
    every <i>t</i> units, you define a new function that loops when <i>z</i> is between 
    0 and <i>t</i>:
    <blockquote>
      <i>F</i><sub>loop</sub>(<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>,&nbsp;<i>z</i>) = 
      ( (<i>t</i> - <i>z</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>,&nbsp;<i>z</i>) + 
      (<i>z</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>,&nbsp;<i>z</i> - <i>t</i>) )
      / (<i>t</i>)
    </blockquote>    
    Now each function call takes twice as long to calculate, but since you're probably
    not going to use this cycling technique in real time, it probably doesn't matter.<p>
    
    <b>The explanation</b></p><p>
    Consider
    the graph of a noise function <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>,&nbsp;<i>z</i>) for
    some fixed <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.  The problem is, you want <i>F</i>(0) = <i>F</i>(<i>t</i>)
    and there is no guarantee that will be the case with any old <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>t</i>.
    Actually, since any given <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> should have no influence on the repeating
    aspect of the animation, we can for all practical purposes throw them out while
    we're developing our repeating function, and consider the simplified case of
    a one-dimensional noise function <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>).</p><p>

    </p><center><img src="The%20Perlin%20noise%20math%20FAQ_files/repeatorig.gif" height="110" width="124"><br>
    <i>A one-dimensional noise function</i></center><p>
    
    We need to take this function and change it into one where it is guaranteed
    that <i>F</i>(0) = <i>F</i>(<i>t</i>).  Here's an expanded view of our
    noise function showing its behavior from -<i>t</i> to <i>t</i>:</p><p>
    
    </p><center><img src="The%20Perlin%20noise%20math%20FAQ_files/repeatposneg.gif" height="110" width="219"><br>
    <i>The same, function, ranging over a positive and negative domain</i></center><p>

    Now we define a new function <i>F</i>'(<i>z</i>) that behaves like <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>)
    when <i>z</i> is near zero, but behaves like <i>F</i>(<i>z</i> - <i>t</i>) when 
    <i>z</i> is near <i>t</i>.  If you think about it, you see that 
    <i>F</i>'(0) = <i>F</i>(0), and that 
    <i>F</i>'(<i>t</i>) = <i>F</i>(<i>t</i> - <i>t</i>) = <i>F</i>(0).
    We can do this with a simple linear interpolation by considering a linear function
    which is equal to <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>) at 0, and equal to <i>F</i>(<i>z</i> - <i>t</i>)
    at <i>t</i>.</p><p>
    
    High school algebra tells us that this linear function has a slope of 
    </p><blockquote>
      (<i>rise</i>) / (<i>run</i>) = 
      (<i>F</i>(<i>z</i> - <i>t</i>) - <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>)) /
      (<i>t</i> - 0) = (<i>F</i>(<i>z</i> - <i>t</i>) - <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>)) / <i>t</i>
    </blockquote>
    and an intercept of <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>).  Now we set up <i>F</i>' as this linear 
    interpolation operating on <i>z</i>:
    <blockquote>
    <i>F</i>'(<i>z</i>) = <i>slope</i>(<i>z</i>) + <i>intercept</i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    = ( (<i>F</i>(<i>z</i> - <i>t</i>) - <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>)) / <i>t</i> )(<i>z</i>) + <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    = ( ( (<i>z</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>z</i> - <i>t</i>) - (<i>z</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>) ) / <i>t</i> ) + <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    = ( ( (<i>z</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>z</i> - <i>t</i>) - (<i>z</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>) ) / <i>t</i> ) + (<i>t</i> / <i>t</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    = ( (<i>z</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>z</i> - <i>t</i>) - (<i>z</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>) + (<i>t</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>)) / (<i>t</i>)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    = ( (<i>z</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>z</i> - <i>t</i>) + (<i>t</i>-<i>z</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>) ) / (<i>t</i>)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    = ( (<i>t</i>-<i>z</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>z</i>) + (<i>z</i>) * <i>F</i>(<i>z</i> - <i>t</i>) ) / (<i>t</i>)<br>
    </blockquote>
    Which is basically the same as the function given above.  If you look
    at <i>F</i>' next to <i>F</i>, you can see that the function does indeed
    repeat in that <i>F</i>'(0) = <i>F</i>'(<i>t</i>).  Also notice that
    the peaks just to the right of <i>F</i>'(0) are the same as the peaks just
    to the right of <i>F</i>'(0), and that the peaks just to the left of
    <i>F</i>'(<i>t</i>) are virtually identical to the peaks just to the 
    left of <i>F</i>(<i>0</i>).

    If you had a little calculus and too much free time, you could prove that
    this looping (and the tiling in the next section) is truly seamless:
    not only does <i>F</i>(0) = <i>F</i>'(<i>t</i>), but all their derivatives
    should match up as well.  Which means that no one should be able to tell
    where the repeat actually happens.</p><p>

    Say you're using a noise function to generate textures for a polygon-based engine.
    Chances are, you might want the textures to be tileable.  You can extend the
    above example to generate
    tileable 2-dimensional noise that repeats every <i>w</i> units in the x dimension
    and every <i>h</i> units in the y dimension.  This will require a weighted sum
    of four calls to the original function (which again, for lack of imagination,
    we will call <i>F</i>).
    
    <blockquote>
    <i>F</i><sub>tileable</sub>(<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>) = ( <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>) * (<i>w</i> - <i>x</i>) * (<i>h</i> - <i>y</i>) + <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <i>F</i>(<i>x</i> - <i>w</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>) * (<i>x</i>) * (<i>h</i> - <i>y</i>) + <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <i>F</i>(<i>x</i> - <i>w</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i> - <i>h</i>) * (<i>x</i>) * (<i>y</i>) + <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i> - <i>h</i>) * (<i>w</i> - <i>x</i>) * (<i>y</i>)<br>
    ) / (<i>w</i><i>h</i>)
    </blockquote>
    
    A pattern should be emerging here, so it shouldn't surprise you that you'll need
    evaluate a weighted sum of 8 calls to the noise function if you want to have
    a repeating animation that tiles in the x and y dimenstions.  I'm not going to write
    it out here out of space considerations, and also because it should be evident what 
    the sum will be.
