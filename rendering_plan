Sprite texture data will be encoded and sent in this format:
Each pixel is THREE bytes, as RGB maybe
But, R represents a colour index. The colour palette will be sent as a uniform
G will represent alpha
and B will represent SUCEPTIBILITY.
SUCEPTIBILITY will be split into 2 bit segments (hence 4 segments)

Four "hues" will be uploaded as a uniform.
The pixels will be transformed to show different hue variations, with the degree of transformation depending on
the seceptibility segment (4 degrees of hue stengths).
2 of the segments can be used for skin variations. Another for eye color, etc

The original original plan was to keep skin overlay and eyes etc in the same category as equipment, so
they move around "with" the main guy but have their own spritesheets
But this will make things easier. Less number of sprites, and easier to draw too. The only variation was color anyway.
Well things like eyes and hair actually may vary from character to character... hmm...

I'll clarify once again: the third byte is being used as an alpha channel of sorts for an overlay effect of a hue given as a uniform.
You can combine some segments when you need more detailed overlay. Skin can take 2 segments and have 8 degrees etc.
